# Waterlogformer: A Multimodal Model for Waterlogging Prediction

## Introduction

Waterlogformer is a multimodal model for WD prediction.

To model ***hydrological mechanisms*** and effectively fuse ***multimodal data***, a dual-branch multimodal architecture is developed for WD prediction, comprising three key components:

* **Rainfall Branch** — employs a Terrain-aware Rainfall Accumulation Unit which simulates rainfall accumulation over time and across locations under specific terrain conditions, embedding hydrodynamic knowledge of how rain propagates over landscapes.
* **Waterlogging Branch** — leverages historical WD time series together with static geographical information to capture spatio-temporal waterlogging patterns while respecting geographic constraints.
* **Multimodal Fusion Prediction Module** — integrates rainfall and historical WD representations and incorporates a distance- and terrain-similarity–based contrastive learning mechanism to enhance sensitivity to critical geographical factors during multimodal fusion.

Experiment results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance of Waterlogformer.
